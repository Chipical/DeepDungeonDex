      They are both golems, but look different.
    There are two different enemies named "Iseki".
      They are both Maroliths, but one is green, and the other is purple.

  Also be aware of the wall trap on these floors.
HoH61: |
  Mimics are in gold chests and cannot be stunned starting on this set.
  "Onryo" are the worst thing to fight here, but they’re proximity agro, so you won’t always be able to avoid them.
  Be aware of the wall trap on these floors.

  You’ll likely want to pop pomanders of raising and intuition at the start of this set, as platinum sacks start to drop here.
  Do be careful running into the middle of rooms to collect hoards though, as traps are often deadly here.
  It’s safest if you’ve used a pomander of safety, sight, or concealment,
    or if you’re planning to use a pomander of petrification or a magicite.
  This is the last set in which you can find pomanders of raising, though they are at an increased rate.
  Watch out for the wraiths’ and elbsts’ out of combat AoEs as they can one shot you if you’re not paying attention.
  Mammoths can also cause problems if you’re concealed.
  There are a lot of large AoEs in these floors - make sure you’re familiar and know how to avoid or stop them.
  Floors 71-73 are known to have a lot of landmines.
  Tanks especially can use pomander of sight on these floors to take advantage of this.
  Be aware of the wall trap on these floors.
HoH81: |
  Don’t forget to use a pomander of raising at the start of the set. More cannot be found here, unfortunately.
  Be very careful if you’re going for hoards!
  Floors 84-86 are the worst, mainly due to Shinzei patrols that nobody wants to fight.
  These are usually good candidates for flight/alteration/petrification/magicite.
  Floors 87-89 are known to have a lot of landmines.
  Tanks especially can use pomander of sight on these floors to take advantage of this.

  Don’t forget to use a pomander of raising at the start of the set. More cannot be found here, unfortunately.

  Floors 91-93, the best thing to fight solo are WHMs.
    If you can LoS their Stone casts, you can avoid taking any damage.
    You can practice LoSing on Sprites down on floor 11+, as it is not easy.
    You’ll likely want to avoid WARs.
  Floors 94-96 are the worst in this set, so ideal to use flight/alteration/petrification/magicite on.
  Floors 97-99 actually have the easiest enemies.
  Floor 99 is guaranteed to have 3 enchantments, so do your best to save a serenity for it.
